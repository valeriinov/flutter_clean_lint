## avoid_commented_out_code

### Description:

This rule flags any code that is commented out in your Dart and Flutter files.

### Motivation:

Commented-out code fragments clutter your codebase, reduce readability, and often lead to confusion
about whether a piece of code is still relevant. All changes are already tracked in version control
systems (such as Git), so thereâ€™s no need to keep old or unused code in comments.
By enforcing this rule, you keep your project clean and focused only on active, working code.

### Example:

```dart
// BAD: There is commented-out code mixed with active code.
final value = 42;
// print('Debug value: $value');

final result = calculate(value);
// int oldResult = oldCalculate(value);

// GOOD: No commented-out code, only relevant and clean code remains.
final value = 42;
final result = calculate(value);
```
