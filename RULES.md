## avoid_commented_out_code

### Description:

This rule flags any code that is commented out in your Dart and Flutter files.

### Motivation:

Commented-out code fragments clutter your codebase, reduce readability, and often lead to confusion
about whether a piece of code is still relevant. All changes are already tracked in version control
systems (such as Git), so there’s no need to keep old or unused code in comments.
By enforcing this rule, you keep your project clean and focused only on active, working code.

### Example:

```dart
// BAD: There is commented-out code mixed with active code.
final value = 42;
// print('Debug value: $value');

final result = calculate(value);
// int oldResult = oldCalculate(value);

// GOOD: No commented-out code, only relevant and clean code remains.
final value = 42;
final result = calculate(value);
```
